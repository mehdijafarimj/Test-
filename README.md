It's just for some test to be familiar with GitHub .
so it's my first test for Github and I'm changing it from notepad in poweshell.
I think that I've to practice a little more in this space.
Now I understood that when I wanna to write or change a file I've to commit that and after that commit I can push that into my repository! .
